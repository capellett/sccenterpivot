The irrigation opportunities were derived from another research project, described in Pellett 2024 Appendix I. Here they are simply added to this R-package.

```{r eval=F}
opportunities <- readRDS("../data-raw/opportunities/opportunities_rank.rds")
```


```{r eval=F}
usethis::use_data(opportunities)
```
